# Web-based Image Classification Project README

This project allows users to upload images of dogs or cats, which are then classified into categories using pre-trained deep learning models. The project is built using Python and the Flask web framework.

# About

This project was created as a demonstration of web-based image classification using deep learning models. It can be customized to use different models and categories as needed. The project is intended for educational purposes and can serve as a starting point for building more complex image classification web applications.
